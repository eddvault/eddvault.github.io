<p>And for those concerned over my health, everything is going well it&#8217;s just taking a very long time to get back to my normal state, and no this wont be my last hospital stay, i still have a transplant to have!</p>

<p>Sorry for the lack of updates guys, but i am still working on stuff. It&#8217;s just i&#8217;m back in hospital for the second round of Chemotherapy so <strong>Hammer and Fail 2 is on pause again</strong>, but i got a lot done on my time out  (it&#8217;s inches from being finished!).

		<p style="text-align: left;">So again, sorry to the few awesome people of you out there that keep up to date with my <em>rapidly decreasing </em>blog posts, but i have posted little news on here as of late for one big reason.<br/>
I&#8217;ve been in <strong>hospital</strong>. <em>Fun</em>, huh?<br/>
Many of you may already know this/not care about this,but it&#8217;s all explained in this youtube video posted about a month ago. (starring the actual me, gasp!)</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">So as hilarious as that was, basically yeah, <strong>Hammer and Fail 2</strong> is behind in schedule, but i still work on it when i can. Even been writing <strong>new episodes</strong> for later! But that&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening animation wise.</p>

<p> So yeah Zanta Claws III came out on the 22nd, if ou didn&#8217;t know about it until now well, shame on you i guess? I&#8217;ve only just been able to post on this blog due to all that virus malarky, so i&#8217;m a bit behind in telling you all! I&#8217;m glad so many of you like it, especially the musical number which is a first for eddsworld. Although next time we have a musical number we hope to improve, as always, and preferebly not go for a rap.. but we will see!<br/>
 The Hammer and Fail Pt. 2 script is pretty much done, so production of that one should start before the end of January, as i have something else hidden up my sleeve, hopefully!</p>
<p> The episode will also be released on Eddsworld tomorrow (hopefully), there&#8217;s been a delay what with being home for Christmas and what not. And this goes double for the comics, as i am TWO comics behind now! So i will hopefully be back on track before the new year starts!</p>

		<p>Hey guys, <strong>Zanta Claws 3</strong> is on it’s way – hopefully. I’m hard at work on it still. Here is a little proof of that:<br/>
<img style="display: inline; border-width: 0px;" title="zan4" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101216045153im_/http://www.eddsworld.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/zan4_thumb.png" border="0" alt="zan4" width="478" height="269"/><br/>
But seeing as we are now entering the month of December, on the build up to <strong>Zanta Claws 3</strong> i’ve decided to do the same i did for <strong>Zanta Claws 2</strong> and host a <strong>tiny fan art competition</strong>!</p>
<p>Rules &amp; Conditions:<br/>
1. Be sure to save your drawing as a jpg or png.<br/>
2. No tracing, no one likes a tracer!<br/>
3. Make sure it’s Zanta Claws related! Tis the season!<br/>
4. Send it in to <a href="mailto:edd@eddsworld.co.uk">edd@eddsworld.co.uk</a> before December 25th (ZC3 won’t necessarily be released at the end on the Competition, but one can only hope!)</p>
<p>The best drawing will receive a<em> free shirt or something</em>, and a few runners up should hopefully get a little something too!<br/>
I’ll be post some of my<strong> favourite ones</strong> here over the course of the next few weeks!</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

Tom’s only recently got the entire script down and if producing the soundscape as we go along (gee we almost sound<em> professional</em>) and here is a pic to prove I ain’t lyin’ or nuffin’    <br/>&#160;<img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="face" border="0" alt="face" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101216045153im_/http://www.eddsworld.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/face1.png" width="603" height="339"/>     <br/> And i’m also (at the same time as this, jeeeez) working on my first (of two) <strong>final university animation</strong>, at the same time as working on a rough version of my <em>dissertation (ugh)</em>. And that animation looks something like this;    <br/><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="test1" border="0" alt="test1" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101216045153im_/http://www.eddsworld.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/test12.png" width="600" height="337"/>&#160; <br/> Painted backgrounds, oooo. Freaky, right?    <br/>Also as many of you should of sussed by now, i will be at the <strong>London MCM Expo</strong> at the end of this month.

<p><em>What gets your juices flowing?</em>     <br/>Watching funny films, television or just listening to music. But sometimes i just sneeze and the idea hits me, because that’s just how my brain works apparently.     </p>
<p><strong>Pt. 2: COMICS CONSUMER</strong>     <br/><em>What kind of comics do you like to read?</em>     <br/>I ‘m into comics that make me laugh a lot of the time.. i.e. <em>Scott Pilgrim</em>, <em>Garfield</em>, Various webcomics, <em>Mad</em> magazine etc. But I&#8217;m also into stuff like the <em>Marvel Zombies</em> or <em>Army of Darkness</em> series, because I&#8217;m kind of into zombies and such as you may know.&#160; </p>
<p><em>What kind of comics do you dislike?</em>     <br/>I haven’t really gotten into many Manga series’ yet.. But there are some comics i just don’t like based on the drawing style they use. Especially when the front cover is made to look amazing and when you open it they have an entirely different artist!     </p>
<p><em>When were you first introduced to comics?</em>     <br/>Newspaper comics, The Beano/The Dandy, Tintin etc.&#160; <br/>&#160; <br/><em>What were some of your first comics?</em>     <br/><em>The Beano, Peanuts, Garfield, Dilbert</em>..     </p>
<p><em>When did you first get &quot;The spark&quot;?</em>     <br/>Probably reading the <em>Beano</em>, ever since i was like seven i have been drawing comic books, even if it was just for my own amusement.     </p>
<p><em>What is your favourite animated movie?</em>     <br/>I have a lot of favourite animated movies but some of my main favourites, other than the obvious <em>Disney</em> films are; <em>Beavis &amp; Butthead Do America</em>,<em> The Spongebob Squarepants movie</em>,<em> Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs</em>,<em> The emperors new groove</em>,<em> The South Park movie</em>.. Yeah i’m kind of a fan of when a animated series actually produces a great movie.     </p>
<p><em>What is your favourite anime series?</em>     <br/>Only three i watched intentionally were The original <em>Pokemon</em> series, <em>Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-Chan</em> and <em>Azumanga Daioh</em>     </p>
<p><strong>Pt. 3: COMICS CREATOR</strong>     <br/><em>What kind of comics do you make?</em>     <br/>I usually make all kinds, but as of late i have just been doing 3-4 panel joke ones.     <br/>&#160; <br/><em>When did you first start making comics?</em>     <br/>Six or seven?     </p>
<p>What are your favourite comic artists right now?     <br/>Sean Phillips, Mike Pearse, Bryan Lee O’Malley and the amazing K.C. Green.     </p>

		<p>Sorry for the reeeaaally late blog post, but i&#8217;ve been waiting for news to build up.    <br/> Firstly, the next eddisode, <strong><em>Hammer &amp; Fail</em></strong>, is coming along well, <em>should</em> be done before the end of the month! Below is a Screenie of a scene i just finished:    <br/><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="haf1" border="0" alt="haf1" src="Scrambled Edd_files/haf1.png" width="451" height="254"/>&#160; </p>
<p>Secondly, You can check out the second &#8216;<strong><em>So here&#8217;s how it went down</em></strong>&#8216; episode i made for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100918171603/http://www.weebls-stuff.com/" target="_blank">Weebl</a>. <iframe width="560" height="340" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6J03g8iS3PA?si=aq2JoUli6SmhoXI3" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>   </p>
<p> Thirdly, I&#8217;m going to have <strong>a table at the upcoming <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100918171603/http://www.londonexpo.com/" target="_blank">MCM Expo</a> </strong>in London this October along with Matt and Tom. We&#8217;re going to be selling all kind of goodies, books and shirts etc. And we&#8217;re also going to have some <strong>exclusive merchandise</strong> for the Expo, which i&#8217;ll slowly be <strong><em>revealing</em></strong> as i get them, such as <strong>these wristbands</strong>:    <br/><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="DSCF4081" border="0" alt="DSCF4081" src="Scrambled Edd_files/158049596.jpg" width="449" height="336"/>&#160; <br/> After the Expo the <strong>remaining stock</strong> will be for sale online, but it&#8217;s cheaper to buy them at the <strong>Expo</strong>! Also, we&#8217;ll probably be giving out free bits for <em>Eddsworld-related-costumes</em>, So yeah hope to see some of you guys there!</p>

		<p>Hey guys,<br/>
I&#8217;m back from <strong>San Diego Comic-con</strong>, it was awesome of the <em>highest</em> variety. Not many people recognised me or anything, hello to those who did, but it was <strong>awesome</strong> meeting people i admire and such. I didn&#8217;t  meet everyone i intended to, but the actual convention was so big it&#8217;s probably visable from space, so that&#8217;s to be expected. Looks like Tomee Bear had some fun too:<br/>

Anyway, Now i&#8217;m back i can carry on working on the <strong>next Eddisode</strong> (<em>Hammer and Fail</em>) but not for long as i&#8217;m off again down to <strong>Devon</strong> for a week on a family holiday, haha. But normal service will resume soon. Also tommorrow will hopefully be a <strong>double comic update</strong> (<em>Double update all the way, So intense</em>) to make up for the missing comic last week when i was away and junk. Speaking of comics, be sure to check out the comic section which looks slightly different now thanks to the marvelous Amy, whom shall be making changes here and there over the coming months so uh, don&#8217;t be alarmed?</p>

		<p>So it’s been a good <em>month</em> or so since my last post.. apologies for that, but I&#8217;ve been rather busy doing various things. Those who were following the <strong>story arc</strong> will know it has just ended, and to those who hated the story arc.. well it’s over now!     <br/>As for animation news, the <strong>BBC Mitchell &amp; Webb short</strong> was finished a <em>while</em> ago, but I&#8217;m just waiting for them to upload it so i can link it everywhere and such. Some of you may of noticed i have also made a <em>viral video</em> for <strong>Marmite</strong> with <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100513234307/http://www.cakebomb.co.uk/tomska/" target="_blank">Tom</a></strong>, which you can see here: <iframe width="560" height="340" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/am6fco14Gi0?si=lwaoNTzR2UGDEN50" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></embed></object>    <br/>Other than that I&#8217;m working on the<strong> ‘Dentist’ short</strong> currently, starring the voices of <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100513234307/http://www.youtube.com/user/HarryPartridge" target="_blank">Harry Partridge</a></em>, me and <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100513234307/http://www.cakebomb.co.uk/tomska/" target="_blank">Tom</a></em>. While i am still planning <strong>the next Eddsworld</strong> and <strong>three other possible series&#8217;</strong> I&#8217;ve been asked to make for other people.     <br/>I’ve also made a <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100513234307/http://www.zazzle.com/edd_wut_shirt_light_colours-235829473336949632" target="_blank">new shirt design</a></strong> you can find in the Worldwide Zazzle store (shortly European Spreadshirt too) which looks like this: <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100513234307im_/http://rlv.zcache.com/edd_wut_shirt_light_colours-p2358294733369496321f52_125.jpg"/>     <br/>You can find it in the store section on the main site. But that about wraps it up for this post&#8230;     </p>
<p>P.S. If you haven&#8217;t seen the <strong>Tomee Bear</strong> <em>Cattadolls </em>made, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100513234307/http://twitpic.com/1jeihb" target="_blank">clicky here</a>.</p>

I&#8217;m currently working on a commission for the <strong>BBC</strong> and even more importantly, it&#8217;s for <strong>Mitchell &amp; Webb</strong>. Basically me and a bunch of other people (such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100411005129/http://www.youtube.com/harrypartridge"><em>happyharry</em></a><em>)</em> have been asked to create <strong>animations for comedy sketches</strong>. I&#8217;m sure to all you non-UK people out there these things mean nothing, but either way you will be able to watch the video on their site from anywhere in the world once it&#8217;s finished!    <br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100411005129/http://www.eddsworld.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/lol.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="lol" border="0" alt="lol" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100411005129im_/http://www.eddsworld.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/lol-thumb.png" width="240" height="95"/></a>     <br/>&#160; Also working on another short, continuing my series of short flashes (first being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100411005129/http://eddsworld.co.uk/pages/flash/stare.png"><em>Staring Contest</em></a>) based around a<strong> dentist</strong> and i’m also continuing the current comic <em>story arch</em>.    <br/> University wise, i finished my last project, which was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HujDJ83FJ-4"><strong>this dinosaur ident thing</strong></a>. My next project is a joint one with my friend Ross and so far looks like it will turn out pretty nice, so i’ll keep you posted!</p>

<p>OMG the <strong>one hundredth comic</strong> is up! So uh, go check that out..   <br/>Next week starts the next <em>story arc</em> for the comics too, so uh look out for that.   <br/>Currently I&#8217;m working on some university work, as well as a <strong>commission</strong> I&#8217;ll working on. Unfortunately it’s not Eddsworld related, but it’s still going to be funny!   <br/>As for the next ‘<em>eddisode</em>’ i think i make it two 5-minute parts, rather than a <strong>huge</strong> 10 minute one.. That way you guys get to see something sooner, it gives me more time to think up more to add to it and gets you excited about the second half.. but i haven’t got much more news other than that at the moment.</p>

<p>Well, it’s been <em>quite</em> a while since my last blog post, so I&#8217;m just here to fill you in on stuff and.. yeah. <strong><em>WTFuture</em></strong> is progressing along nicely, I&#8217;m pretty confident it’ll be out <strong>February</strong> sometime.. and here’s a screenshot of the scene I&#8217;m currently working on.<br/>

Then as for the comics, i think the next story arc will begin after Comic #100 (Yeah, I&#8217;m surprised it’s lasted that long too)<br/>
I’ve also finished a <strong>live-action</strong> <strong>short film</strong> for my <em>Video &amp; Sound elective</em> for University, don’t expect anything amazing, but you can watch that by <strong><em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjsgY_ISITw" target="_blank">clicking here</a></em></strong>.

I&#8217;m glad so many of you enjoyed the christmas short <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100201064928/http://eddsworld.co.uk/pages/flash/EWXMAS09.htm"><strong><em>Xmas Day</em></strong></a>, it was just a simple little something for the holidays while i continued to work on the next eddisode, <strong><em>WTFuture</em></strong>.

I&#8217;m also planning to start another Story arc in the comics soon, not sure when but you might expect it to start in a week or two.

Have also been mucking about with <em>Garry&#8217;s Mod</em> but i&#8217;m currently very sucky at it.</p>

<p>Coo-ee once again!   <br/>Well some of you may of noticed the winter title is up, not really that amazing – but soon it will have a winter flash to join it! The Christmas short called ‘Xmas Day’ should be available to watch in a week or so.

Just to let you know what’s happening now, I&#8217;m putting WTFuture (the next Eddisode) on hold, because I&#8217;m planning to create a short flash for Christmas. I will continue on WTFuture after Christmas, but for now I&#8217;m going to be working on this (:<br/>
Also some of you may like to see my <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ut7yNKPQnw" target="_blank">stop-motion project</a> i did with others for class and a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Qvb-QlMhTU" target="_blank">news report i was interviewed for</a>.</p>

<p>The next eddisode (<em>WTFuture</em>) is still slowly coming along, waiting on a few lines and stuff. Also I&#8217;m sorry for the lack of a Halloween flash, but there <em>should</em> be a Christmas flash later this year.. but most likely not a big epic one or anything. I’ve been particularly busy this week with university stuff, doing <strong>stop-motion animation</strong> for a group project.. it’s pretty time consuming. I have also been avidly playing <strong>Battlefield Heroes</strong>.. pretty addictive (my user on there is <em>eddsworld</em> if you wanna play me at all).    <br/> So yeah work work play play sleep sleep work work etc.</p>

<p>Hello peoples,     <br/>Just letting you know i am still slowly chugging on with the <strong>next eddisode</strong>, as well as a few side projects and so forth. Also recieved a shiny new<strong> PC</strong> for my birthday (Similar to that mentioned in the latest comic), which is making flash work better than it did before – which is always handy. It also has the new <em>Windows 7</em>, which is suprisingly nice to use. With some handy features such as a blogging one that i am currently using as a type this. Oh and more importantly, i was given a <strong>Nerf gun</strong>, those are<em> always</em> awesome.     <br/>Thanks to those who gave birthday greetings on the day, was awesome to find so many dotted around the internet (:     </p>
<p>P.S. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091129222319/http://www.popcap.com/games/pvz">Plants vs. Zombies</a> is an awesome game</p>

<p>So yeah, i&#8217;m glad most of you liked the Climate Change eddisode even though it was different from the normal ones. A fair few of you had some concerns about the video, but the views inside the flash were simply what happens in climate change and how to help stop it - Hopefully to spread the word to more people. But i knew some people would just ignore or disagree with that entirely, so i wanted to be able to entertain those people with the rest of the video.<br/>
Anyway, the next Eddisode will be back to normal (i say normal, this is turning out to be a long one) and it is coming along great! I&#8217;ll hopefully have a new screenshot for you during the week.</p>

Last Monday i was left stranded without any internet, so the past week i have been offline. Mainly animating, but i have also been playing Beatles Rock band, Megaman 9 and Pokemon Diamond. So yeah i have kept busy (sort of..) I also have news on the Climate Change eddisode, it should be out early october when they are launching it on thier youtube i believe, so just a bit longer to wait! Kid Thulu (flash game) is still underway, still kind of far from the end but it&#8217;s quite fun to play so far. I have also been working on another eddisode (as most of you could probably tell from the weekly screenshots), and it&#8217;s coming along smoothly.  Also the &#8216;Accident&#8217; story arc that has been the theme for the past few comics will probably finish in about 2 comics at least, i hope you guys have enjoyed this arc, it&#8217;s been intresting having a little story unfold within the weekly strips.<br/>
I&#8217;ve also noticed a couple of people commenting that there hasn&#8217;t been as many flashes this year, and simply put it&#8217;s because i have been much more busier this past year than those before, sorry :C<br/>

The <strong>Copenhagen climate change Eddisode</strong> will apparently be up on thier youtube account sometime in <em>September</em>, so i can link it as soon as it&#8217;s up. The <strong>Kid Thulu game</strong> i am making for the <em>&#8216;Power of Three</em>&#8216; contest with Psycosis91 and TheWaves is going alright, i&#8217;d say we were approaching the half way mark.

The <strong>commission</strong> for the <em>Climate change</em> people is <strong>finished</strong>, i&#8217;m not sure when they will put it up but it should be soon <em>hopefully</em>. But now thats done and dusted, i&#8217;m working on the flash game with Psycosis, which is going to be a <em>platformer</em> called <strong>Kid Thulu</strong>, as well as scripting and planning another &#8216;Eddisode&#8217;. In other life related news, i have moved <em>back</em> to university for the second year, into a new student house with <strong>seven</strong> other friends. Yeah, <em>seven</em>.

<p>In other news, the eddisode i was making for the <em><strong>Copenhagen Climate Change Conference</strong></em> is very nearly finished. <strong>BUT</strong> keep in mind <strong>i <em>won&#8217;t</em> be releasing</strong> <strong>this</strong>, because they are going to own the rights for this one so it is up to <em>them</em> when it is going to be released on <em>thier</em> Youtube account and such. But i will link it on here as SOON as it&#8217;s online and available to watch, i can promise you that!<br/>
But seeing as that flash is nearly out of the way im starting to work on bits for another, more info when i have it and stuff <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20090830033911im_/http://www.eddsworld.co.uk/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley"/></p>

Second up, the commissioned eddisode for the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference is coming along nicely, should be finished before long - But it is up to them when it can be shown on the internet, but as soon as this commission or the last one is up online, i will put the link up on the site for you guys to check it out!<br/>
I was also at the London Film &amp; comic convention last saturday with Tom and Matt, left some drawings in the Artist alley too.. maybe someone recognised them, who knows? haha</p>

		<p>Hey guys, sorry for the late blog update..<br/>
Glad to see most people like <strong><em>Balloon head fred</em></strong>, some didn&#8217;t - but that&#8217;s alright it was only a short, time to move on.<br/>
I have finished working on that commission piece, which i will post on here as soon as the person i made it for decides to put it up online. The <strong>collab</strong> between me and koit is slowly moving along, as well as the <strong>game</strong> i am making for the power of three contest with Psycosis91.<br/>
The next project i am working on is <em>another</em> commissioned one, but this time starring our usual gang - It is for the <strong>Copenhagen Climate Change Conference</strong> later this year, and they have asked me to make an eddsworld related video to be shown at the conference (in front of over a hundred heads of state from around the globe) and spread the word on global warming. As dull as that may sound, you can believe i am going to be trying to make it as fun as my usual stuff while delivering the important message it should! The length of it should be longer than a usual short so you have that to look forward to!</p>
<p>P.S. The Playlist in the top right is not working for most people.. if you can suggest somewhere i can find another, that would be helpful : D</p>

First of all if you didnt realise already by the startling change on the frontpage, <strong>Balloon Head Fred</strong> was finished!<br/>

Well the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090622154824/http://www.eddsworld.co.uk/comic/comic.htm">comic</a> was put up last sunday, hope you enjoyed! I&#8217;m also glad <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090622154824/http://eddsworld.co.uk/pages/flash/sndwch.htm">Sandwich</a> went down pretty well (Hee hee) i know some of you didn&#8217;t like it, but most of you were nice about it.. Those of you following my Twitter updates on the frontpage will also know i have been experimenting with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090622154824/http://eddsworld.deviantart.com/art/Simple-shading-test-124424753" target="_blank">some shading</a> and  i also drew <a href="https://eddvault.notion.site/25-forum-faces-b66e83f602284f38aeecc09615c004bb" target="_blank">25 of the forums members</a> (was a limited offer) so you can have a look at those if you haven&#8217;t already.  Coming up next animation wise, is a another short non-eddsworld-guys animation which i&#8217;ll just call &#8216;B H Fred&#8217; for now, but this time it&#8217;s actually a short rather than a music video. I have gotten the script and some of the music done, so it shouldn&#8217;t be too long - maybe this week or the next. After this is done i should hopefully be starting to plan Eddisode 21 properly =P</p>

Thanks to everyone for thier support, a lot of effort went into the music video to make it worthy of such a great song. And in other news, the latest comic is up today and i&#8217;m hopefully going to continue with some of the new Koit/Eddsworld collab tommorrow! I have also formed a group with <strong>Psycosis91</strong> (Who codes my games) and <strong>TheWaves</strong> (Who made the intro music for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090622154824/http://eddsworld.co.uk/pages/flash/makers.htm">Moviemakers</a>) for the Newgrounds &#8216;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090622154824/http://www.newgrounds.com/powerofthree/" target="_blank">Power of three</a>&#8216; summer event - which basically means we shall be making a game together over the next few months, hopefully meaning it will be an awesome game!</p>

Well, it&#8217;s nice to see <strong>Moviemakers</strong> was such a success amongst the majority of you - makes me feel less worse about taking <em>slightly </em>longer than usual to make it, but apparently most of you appreciated the effort me and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090510115010/http://www.cakebomb.co.uk/tomska" target="_blank">Tom</a> put in, so it means a lot guys! Even more bizarre was the large following the girl and shoe recieved for some reason, and to put most of your questions to rest - No they are not &#8216;joining the team&#8217; but yes, they may be returning in other flashes, so keep an eye out. But anywho, moving progressively onwards - next up on the agenda is a little <em>minute-long-music-video</em> to a song by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090510115010/http://www.parrygripp.com/" target="_blank">Parry Gripp</a>, whom has deemed it to be an <strong>official</strong> one which is pretty awesome of him.. Comics and stuff <em>should</em> still be on schedule&#8230; oh and i know i haven&#8217;t updated the <strong>Unrelated section</strong> in ages, so i&#8217;ll get onto that soon [i hope].</p>

		<p> <strong>Edit</strong>: Evidently everyone despises the new haircut, but oh well it was only in that one comic. So calm down already, i was just trying something new. Thanks to those whom said it politely.</p>
<p>New comic up, the font has changed back <em>temporarily</em>, because i do not have the font on this laptop - but i shall fix it once i return to my PC. Also the more eagle-eyed of you may realise Tom&#8217;s hair is <em>slightly</em> different in this comic, because i am contemplating changing it to this to make it seem more&#8230; plausible? And make him blend a bit more with the others.<br/>
And anyway in <strong>Moviemakers</strong> news, it&#8217;s nearly completed. I am aiming to finish it the week after next- so long as all goes well, so expect better news next week!<br/>

		<p>Hey guys, haven&#8217;t been that much progress on the flash this week, mainly because of the <strong>UKwebcomixthing</strong> and <em>deadlines</em> and such. The thing went pretty well, sold a lot of DVDs, comics and badges, however not so many of the shirts sold. Maybe i should sell the leftovers on here or something&#8230; Thanks to everyone who stopped by on the day though, specifically those who bought stuff or asked for drawings!<br/>
And apologies for the delay on <strong>Moviemakers</strong>, but the easter holidays are approaching so it should gimme plenty of time to work on it!</p>
<p>(Oh and because someone asked for it at the thing, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090411205951/http://www.zazzle.co.uk/eddsworld_moving_targets_poster-228840998967749046" target="_blank">here is the Moving Targets poster available for print</a>)</p>

Just another <em>randomly timed</em> blog post to let you know i&#8217;m still working on <strong>Moviemakers</strong>, and to give people a rough idea (because people <em>keep</em> emailing me!) it&#8217;s roughly seventy or so percent done!

<strong>Moviemakers</strong> is coming along kinda slowly at the moment, but it&#8217;s still being worked on. I&#8217;d say it was definitely past half done by now, I&#8217;m <em>hoping</em> it will be done around Easter - but don&#8217;t hold me to that <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20090324022908im_/http://www.eddsworld.co.uk/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley"/><br/>

Well it has been a while since i posted a blog so i thought i&#8217;d just make a quick one to let you know what&#8217;s new!<br/>
I have finally updated the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090221050122/http://eddsworld.co.uk/pages/random.htm">Unrelated section</a> with ten or so new additions, the <strong>new comic </strong>will be up<em> tommorrow</em>, Still working on the next flash (Taking longer than planned!) there is also a new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090221050122/http://eddsworld.wikia.com/wiki/" target="_blank">Wikia for Eddsworld</a> (that needs help being filled up, so come and help by adding a page!), Newgrounds has added an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090221050122/http://www.newgrounds.com/collection/eddsworld" target="_blank">Eddsworld series page</a> (and sent me a nifty certificate from Zanta Claws II getting a Monthly!) and in the forums there is a new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090221050122/http://www.eddsworld.co.uk/forums/chat.php" target="_blank">Chat</a> section! Also in other news i joined Kongregate (a gaming site, for those who don&#8217;t know) recently, but found the username &#8216;eddsworld&#8217; was taken, so i had a look to see and discovered it was someone else posing as me on the website!

		<p>Hello there!<br/>
Me, Matt and Tom are planning to make a <strong>trial podcast</strong>, and if it goes well it may become a regular feature!</p>
<p>What we need you to do however is <strong>send in a question</strong> to ############ with your name (or username) and we will choose the best to answer in the podcast!</p>
<p>But please don&#8217;t ask questions just about the flashes, try being more <em>creative</em> and ask something random or intresting - It will be more likely to be chosen!<br/>
So send them in by this weekend and hopefully it will be in our podcast!</p>

Some of you may of also noticed i changed the menu buttons at the top of the site as well, if not.. well, now you should, haha. I shall also get working on the <strong>double comic update</strong> coming this Sunday. If you have any questions or comments about the flash you <strong>really</strong> want a reply to make sure to post them in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081221123800/http://www.eddsworld.co.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=2319" target="_blank">Zanta Claws II thread</a> in the forums!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also decided to <strong>wipe</strong> my <em>current projects</em> list clean, and only put the ones that i am <strong>actually</strong> working on, rather than have ones not progressing <em>at all</em> for weeks and weeks (you know the ones :P)</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m afraid i&#8217;ve been working hard on Zanta Claws II and moving back home for christmas this weekend, so i didn&#8217;t get a comic done in time..

So, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081214043259/http://www.eddsworld.co.uk/comic/comic.htm">new comic</a> is up and i have been working on the <strong>christmas flash</strong> - which i <em>suppose </em>i can reveal the title of, you can see what it is under &#8216;current projects&#8217; - and here is a snapshot to prove that statement:<br/>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081214043259im_/http://i151.photobucket.com/albums/s134/eddsworld/vroom.jpg"/><br/>
See? I&#8217;m not lying.. honest!</p>
<p>And here are a couple of animated images i done too;<br/>

Managed to update my blog<em> on time </em>this week! A few things to mention, The <strong>new<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081021031521/http://www.eddsworld.co.uk/comic/comic.htm"> comic</a></strong> is up in the comic section and it&#8217;s one of my favorites too! There&#8217;s a <strong>new wallpaper </strong>i made for people to use, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081021031521/http://i151.photobucket.com/albums/s134/eddsworld/ew_wallpaper.png" target="_blank">Click here to see it</a>, there&#8217;s another one in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081021031521/http://www.eddsworld.co.uk/forums" target="_blank">forums</a> too!<br/>
There is a <strong>new shirt design</strong> in the store, a nice simple one too:<br/>

Sorry for the reaaally <strong><em>late </em></strong>blog post this week (or is this next week?), i&#8217;ve just been busy with stuff on and off the site and so forth.<br/>
Last week&#8217;s<strong> guest comic</strong> was from the lovely <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081021031521/http://cor-the-author.deviantart.com/" target="_blank">Michael Chick</a> who does the <strong><em>webcomic</em></strong> &#8216;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081021031521/http://www.drunkduck.com/The_Author/">The Author</a>&#8216; - so be sure to check out his comics too, especially considering he has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081021031521/http://www.drunkduck.com/The_Author/index.php?p=469264" target="_blank">the guest comic i did for him</a> up on his site now!</p>
<p>The <strong>Halloween flash </strong>will hopefully be done in time for halloween, as it is not a very long one (3 minutes at the <em>VERY</em> most) but hopefully enough to entertain you over the holiday..</p>
<p>And stay tuned for the next comic up tomorrow!.. i hope =P<strong><u></p>

First things first, there is a new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081021031521/http://www.eddsworld.co.uk/comic/comic.htm">comic</a> up. Be sure to check that out.</p>
<p>Secondly, right if you haven&#8217;t watched <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081021031521/http://www.eddsworld.co.uk/pages/flash/25.htm">25ft under the seat</a></strong> yet, be sure to watch it before you read the rest of this <em>blog post</em>.</p>
<p>Right, to answer most of your questions, yes, Tord has left Eddsworld, and its highly unlikely he&#8217;ll be coming back. Why did he leave? He has a number of reasons, which is fair enough it was his choice. We are still friends, it&#8217;s not like he left angrily or something. I&#8217;m sorry to the the surprisingly large fan base he has, but if you liked him that much you should really respect his decision (: And no, we are not planning to &#8216;replace&#8217; him with anyone any time soon, we&#8217;re going to keep it as three for a while. C: Oh and for the few of you asking where is Tom&#8217;s &#8216;Holy..&#8217; line, simply put he didn&#8217;t want to do one for this flash.</p>
<p>Anyway, now that that so called &#8216;<em>drama</em>&#8216; is out of the way, i thought i would let you know i am planning to do a short <strong>halloween flash</strong> thing, seeing as i got <strong>25ft</strong> done just in time - maybe 3 minutes at the VERY most, because i&#8217;d like to get it done for Halloween! (Duh, Edd).<br/>
Oh and zombie fans rejoice, a possible new zombeh flash may be in the pipeline (NOT Zombeh Attack 4, Stop asking), but not for a while there&#8217;s still the <strong>halloween</strong> and <strong>christmas</strong> themed flashes to come before all of that!<br/>
More details when i get em!</p>
<p>P.S.<br/>
Oh and Tom would like em to mention his address, so people can sent him fanmail, threats and letter bombs.<br/>
If you would like to know what his new &#8217;student&#8217; address is, check it out at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081021031521/http://www.cakebomb.co.uk/tomska/?p=47" target="_blank">http://www.cakebomb.co.uk/tomska/?p=47</a> (see Tom, i told you i&#8217;d do it)</p>

		<p>Hello all, i have been settling into <strong>university</strong> fine, i have also been busy socialising and what-not. I&#8217;m trying hard to get <strong>25ft under the seat</strong> finished, but it might take a while seeing as I&#8217;m busy making friends in a new place, so bear with me..<br/>
I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be able to manage a big <em>Halloween </em>flash this year though (I&#8217;ll definitely try to make something), but i will try hard to get a <em>Christmas </em>one done. Just i have been busier here than i was at home, so making my flashes <em>may</em> take <strong>longer </strong>than usual (yeah, it sucks :C)<br/>
I did however get the <strong>comic</strong> strip up yesterday, on time as usual, so you can go check it out on the comics page. Oh and there has been some news on the <strong>platformer game</strong>, and that is that we are going to try a <em>different</em> kind of game genre.. more information once i have it though!</p>

		<p> Well, I&#8217;ve been a <em>bit</em> busy <strong>packing</strong> for the past few days as i am moving out to University on Friday, so i  might not be able to do a lot more work on <strong>25ft</strong>. But i did manage to get the new <strong>comic</strong> up last <em>Sunday</em>, just in case some of you missed it..<br/>
It may take a while to get the internet sorted at my new place, but no more than a few days at the most. So Sunday&#8217;s comic <strong>may be delayed</strong> slightly&#8230;<br/>
Anyway, back to <strong>25ft</strong> - here is another snapshot for you all:<br/>

<em>Decipher</em> it how you like, and if i haven&#8217;t got much more of it done by next time i post here, i shall try to put some form of <strong>flash</strong> up here to entertain you!</p>
<p>P.S. Films i&#8217;ve seen recently:<br/>

		<p>Hello all!<br/>
For those who haven&#8217;t noticed, last Sunday the latest comic was uploaded into the comic section for your amusement.<br/>

<p>I decided to finish <strong>Boy/Girl</strong>, even though i started it about a year ago.. so some of it appears somewhat <em>dated</em> compared the rest.. and its not as good as some fot he flash i ahve been making recently, but im glad its over and done with!<br/>
I made it for some friends when they sent me the song and requested i made a video for it. The sound quality is a bit bad in some places, so i dont think this will go onto Newgrounds or anything anytime soon.. But i hope you find soemthing to <strong>enjoy</strong> from it!</p>

		<p>First things first, unless you had your eyes <em>closed</em>, you will have noticed i have slightly rearranged the <strong>main layout of the site</strong>, mainly because i felt like a bit of a change from the normal one&#8230;<br/>
Also while updating the site i have been thinking about other <em>features</em> i could add, and if anyone reading this had any nifty suggestions and whatnot - such as <strong>forums</strong>, <strong>fan art gallery</strong>, <strong>podcast</strong> or <strong>competitions</strong> of some sort! (preferebly the easier to make, the better!)</p>
<p>Right well, in animation news, i have done a fair bit on <strong>Moving Targets</strong> since last week, and to answer a few of your questions, it&#8217;s not going to be <em>really short</em>, but then again it&#8217;s not going to be an <em>epic length</em> one like <strong>Spares</strong> was. It&#8217;s a good few minutes long so far, so theres plenty for you to look forward to!<br/>
Also i have decreased the amount of progress made on <strong>Bang, Boom, Splat!</strong> because Psycosis91 has pointed out to me he has added all these new features and so forth, so it will take a bit longer than he anticipated to complete - but it&#8217;s all looking good!</p>
<p>And finally, i have finished all my college work and been to my <strong>end of year show</strong>, so thats all that wrapped up.. it went pretty well, the people who were browsing seemed to like it- But now it&#8217;s onto <em>University</em> in September to study <strong>Animation Arts</strong>, which should be much more awesome as it involves more animating!<br/>
But until then i should have more time to do some more flash n such! <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080701060409im_/http://www.eddsworld.co.uk/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley"/> </p>
<p>P.S. Also, just came back from seeing <em>The Incredible Hulk</em>. I think a better name would&#8217;ve been <em>The Pretty Incredible Hulk</em>.</p>

Sorry for the late blog post, i guess i have just been working hard on <strong>Moving Targets</strong>&#8230; Not much else has happened since the last update other than that, apart from the <strong>new comic</strong> i put up a few days ago (some of you <em>may</em> of noticed). I also hear from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080701060409/http://www.psy-city.co.uk/" target="_blank">Psycosis91</a> that he has made progress on the coding for <strong>Bang, Boom, Splat!</strong> as well.<br/>
Hope the cool little <strong>animated image</strong> i posted above makes upfor the <em>lateness</em> of this update post!</p>

		<p>Just one or two things to say, theres a <strong>new comic</strong> in the <em><strong>comics section</strong></em> and a few <strong>new avatars</strong> i hadve drawn for friends in the <em><strong>unrelated section</strong></em> of the site<br/>
So, not much to report here, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080607094910/http://www.cakebomb.co.uk/tomska">Tom</a> has been making funny videos in general and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080607094910/http://www.youtube.com/tomska" target="_blank">this seems to be a better time than any other to link to his youtube account</a>!<br/>
Also the &#8216;<em>Super awesome revenge fight music</em>&#8216; from <strong>Spares</strong> is available for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080607094910/http://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/145815" target="_blank">download on newgrounds, by clicking here!</a></p>
<p>As for the &#8216;<em>?????? ???????</em>&#8216; Flash, it&#8217;s called &#8216;<em>Moving Targets</em>&#8216; and is a shorter flash animation i am making and i hope you enjoy it once its finished!<br/>

		<p>Making a lot of progress on <strong>Spares,</strong> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080525075341/http://cakebomb.co.uk/tomska" target="_blank">Tom</a> seems to think i will be done before the end of this week, but i don&#8217;t think so..<br/>
Also i have finished all the animation for my <strong>Final Major Project</strong> for college, my friend is just composing the music for it as we speak.<br/>
Not much progress on <strong>Bang, Boom, Splat!</strong> as far as i know, but i know he&#8217;s working on the action script for it.</p>
<p>And just to clear up any confusion here, the <strong>Platformer game</strong> is <em>Flash</em> based, not on consoles, The <strong>boy/girl</strong> music video is on hiatus (meaning on hold) because i am working on other things, Tom, Tord and Matt are all based on my real friends of the same name and i draw and make all of my work on Macromedia Flash. Hope that clears any of your questions up!</p>

		<p>Not much to say this time, just letting you know i managed to get a lot done on <em><strong>Spares</strong></em> over the holidays - Now I&#8217;m back in college, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m going to stop working on it! I can tell you this is going to be one of the longest animations i have made yet, seeing as its already as long as some of the other ones i have made and its only just over half done!</p>
<p>Also my <em>Final Major Project</em> for my college course is nearly done, its an animation with 2D and 3D animated parts, and i shall try my best to get it on here to show you, even though your not really missing out, its not particularly amazing or anything.</p>
<p>And for those of you who are interested, i put an assortment of the <em>random flash clips</em> i make on here into a small video that i uploaded onto <strong>Youtube</strong>:<br/>
<iframe width="425" height="355" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c4RjS22sG2Q?si=wL6_Qwgc1JT6riOw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><br/>

		<p>Hello people!<br/>
Been animating and such this week, From making  snowmen in the bizarre snow that fell a few days ago and being an extra walkign up and down the street in some student film a friend was making..<br/>
Anyway here are some screenshots of &#8216;<strong>Spares</strong>&#8216; to wet your appetites;<br/>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080504192125im_/http://www.eddsworld.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/spares_pss1.PNG" alt="spares_pss1.PNG"/><br/>
And according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080504192125/http://www.psy-city.co.uk/" target="_blank">Psycosis91</a>, the coding for the game is going alright - and most of the graphics/animation is done for it. And we have also decided the name of the game, which is &#8216;<strong>Bang Boom Splat!</strong>&#8216; and it is basically a <em>shooting gallery</em> of sorts, but there are bonuses, high scores, secrets and all sorts of awesome stuff, and its looking great so far <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080504192125im_/http://www.eddsworld.co.uk/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley"/><br/>
As for the <em>platformer game</em>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080504192125/http://snapester.deviantart.com/">Snapester</a> (the person who is helping code it) says its still in the works, so i&#8217;ll keep you posted!</p>
<p>Also check out the <strong>new eddsworld stickers</strong> i have had made;<br/>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080504192125im_/http://www.eddsworld.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/ttttt.JPG" alt="ttttt.JPG"/><br/>
(the one at the bottom is the new one)<br/>
Its a Matte Vinyl Contour Cut Sticker, and i bought a few to try them out and they are very good! They may be on sale soemtime in the future! <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080504192125im_/http://www.eddsworld.co.uk/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley"/> </p>

<p>But there are only <strong>nine</strong> bundle packs left, so get them why they are still around!</p>
<p>There are also a number of loose badges i will sell at a later date, but there are <strong>only nine complete sets left</strong> - plus this is cheaper than buying all of them individually and you get four stickers too!</p>

		<p>Hey all, just another pointless update saying im alive and such.<br/>
A couple of <strong>new additions</strong> to the current project list, you can see them below. not much to say about either of them at the moment except that im <em>working</em> on them, sort of..<br/>
There may not be much progress for a bit, as i have to get some college work finished - But i hope to actually get a good start before the end of the week.</p>
<p>And for those of you constantly asking for photos and such in the previous blog, you can look at my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302191056/http://www.myspace.com/eddsworld" target="_blank">myspace</a> for them if you really want.<br/>

It means a lot! It would also be nice to see some photos of people wearing them *hint hint*</p>

		<p>The animation, &#8216;<em>Money (That&#8217;s what i want)</em>&#8216; i have been working on for a while is now <strong>finished</strong>! You can watch it on the site, or here is the youtube video!</p>

<p>It is a music video to Barrett Strong&#8217;s version of &#8216;Money (That&#8217;s what i want)&#8217; from 1959.<br/>
This started out as a test to have a break from my usual style, and i hope you enjoy it.</p>

<p> I have also been working a little bit on the <em>money</em> flash, and i have made some <strong>mini badges</strong> (1 inch in diameter) for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080220024842/http://ukwebcomixthing.co.uk/" target="_blank">UK Web &amp; Mini Comix thing</a> next month.<br/>

		<p>Here is my brand spanking new, lemony-fresh, squeaky clean blog!<br/>
No more annoying adverts and having to worry about the bandwidth running out!</p>
<p>In other news, i am now a <strong>Youtube Partner</strong> - which basically means i get some of the revenue from the adverts on my youtube videos&#8217; pages on certain videos <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080217034512im_/http://www.eddsworld.co.uk/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley"/><br/>
Also, if you are feeling generous - clicking the advertisements on the bottom of my page  gives me a tiny bit of money (like $0.02 a click)  so click it whenever you see something you like to support me! <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080217034512im_/http://www.eddsworld.co.uk/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley"/> </p>
<p>Also all my college work is due tommorrow, so maybe after then ill have a chance to stop procrastinating and work on my animations <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080217034512im_/http://www.eddsworld.co.uk/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley"/> </p>
<p>Just to fill up the rest of the space, here is my last video on youtube:</p>
